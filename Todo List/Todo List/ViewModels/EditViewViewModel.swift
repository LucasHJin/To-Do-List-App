//Yes, add an edit screen that is a copy of the item creation screen (and a way to get to it, like swiping right for example). Populate the screen with the current item data from the database. After the user edits the data, theyâ€™ll need a save button. You would have the edited item data get updated in the database exactly like he updated the checkbox in this video at 1:50 (that is, make a copy of it to hold the edited version, and write it to the db in the same way)
